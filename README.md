# TODO's


* improve speed of browsing through data by better use of rowids (instead of limit/offset queries), see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12266025/sqlite-query-optimization-using-limit-and-offset; maybe store beginning and end rowid for each bitext?
* show random sentence alignments: can be done with `ORDER BY RANDOM()`, but this becomes superslow on big corpora (because limit cannot just chop off the first results, ordering needs to be done first) - can we do some cascaded select trick? (see https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-subquery/)
* sort by scores (same problem as above, it becomes slow to order big corpora)
* improve language selection screen (need to scale if many language pairs will be available); could be similar to opus-mt dashboard
* bugfix in link DB: (linkID,sentID) does not have to be unique (Quite a complex change with lots of implications. Can we leave it like this? The chance to have the same sentence twice in one translation unit is quite small.)
* enable editing without sentence index DBs (*.ids.db) - requires to create and update user-specific *linked.db files!
* show average rating per bitext (maybe also corpus?) - DONE (except for corpora)
* allow to search for document names in corpora (relevant for OpenSubtitles etc) - DONE


## bigger plans

* add word alignment information somehow (big change)
* export to xces align format, tmx format?
* allow bitext upload?
* add other views: my rated documents, alignments, ...
* cleanup code, define classes like opusindex, bitext, alignment
* show cleanerScores (but right now there are no scores in the DB)
* relevance ranking in search results?
* enable monolingual search
* enable search in both languages


## other ideas

* link OpenSubtitles to metadata from IMDb (https://datasets.imdbws.com/), remember to add leading '0' to the ID with something like `sprintf('%07d', 12345);`
* add the completely linked subtitles corpus (including alternative subtitles)
